the three files in the folder "codes" are what I wrote for this assignment: 
minmax.py
ABPruning.py
MooreMachine.py

step 1. 
use minmax.py to generate game tree using Minimax Algorithm.
change the number in the last few lines to 7,  9, 12 and run to generate dot files for game tree
paste the output in GraphViz to layout the visualized game tree

step 2. 
use ABPruning.py to generate game tree using Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm.
change the number in the last few lines to 7,  9, 12 and run to generate dot files for game tree
paste the output in GraphViz to layout the visualized game tree 

step 3.
use MooreMachine.py to generate Moore Machine graph
change the number in the last few lines to 7,  15, 21 and run to generate dot files for Moore Machine graph
paste the output in GraphViz to layout the visualized Moore Machine graph
